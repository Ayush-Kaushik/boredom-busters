## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>  
Sometimes, you're super bored and have run out of ideas on what to do. I built the application exactly for that. Also, I wanted to reinforce my leanrning of React Typescript and hooks. I will link the application once its deployed.

I have moved way from using states for constantly managing every single minutiae. Instead I switched to using
context api along with useReducer hook and have seen a improvement in the way I was able to focus on  how a user would be using it, instead of how a developer would program it. If that didn't make sense then follow this link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KzQ9xFSAEU"> useReducer with TypeScript </a>
  
## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "#getting_started"></a>  
- Simply clone the repository, run `npm install` and then run `npm start`. You should be able to access the project locally on `http://localhost:3000`
- Once its deployed on github pages then I'll link it as well.
  
## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>  
Docker Support Coming Soon  
  
## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>  
- On the dashboard, click `lets do something about it button` and it will keep presenting you new ways to stop being bored and do something fun
- Also, with easy switch between light and dark mode on top right, you can pick the theme
- Since Covid is in full force, I do not encourage the activites that involve more than the required number of people as per regulations, So I added a covid alert for activities that ask you to do so.
